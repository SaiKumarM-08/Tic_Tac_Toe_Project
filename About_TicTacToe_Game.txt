The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares. You are X , your friend (or the computer in this case) is O.
Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down,
across, or diagonally) is the winner.

Overview
This game can be played in a 3x3 grid. The game can be played by two players. There are two options fro players:
1. Human
2. Computer

Players:
For the option human, both the players are human and for the option computer, the first player is human and the second
player is computer.

Theory of Game:
Player can choose between two symbols with his opponent, usual games use "X" and "O". If first player choose "X" then
the second player have to play with "O" and vice versa.

A player marks any of the 3x3 squares with his symbol (maybe “X” or “O”) and his aim is to create a straight line
horizontally or vertically or diagonally with two intentions:

    a) Create a straight line before his opponent to win the game.
    b) Restrict his opponent from creating a straight line first.

In case logically no one can create a straight line with his own symbol, the game results a tie.

Hence, there are only three possible results – a player wins, his opponent (human or computer) wins, or it’s a tie.
